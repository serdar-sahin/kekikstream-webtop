# KekikStream.Webtop

## KekikStream Web Based Desktop Application

This is a layered startup solution based on [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Driven-Design) practises. All the fundamental ABP modules are already installed. Check the [Application Startup Template](https://abp.io/docs/latest/startup-templates/application/index) documentation for more info.

### Pre-requirements

* [.NET9.0+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet)
* [Node v18 or 20](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/)

### Configurations

The solution comes with a default configuration that works out of the box. However, you may consider to change the following configuration before running your solution:

* Check the `ConnectionStrings` in `appsettings.json` files under the `KekikStream.Webtop.Blazor` and `KekikStream.Webtop.DbMigrator` projects and change it if you need.

### Before running the application

* Run `abp install-libs` command on your solution folder to install client-side package dependencies. This step is automatically done when you create a new solution, if you didn't especially disabled it. However, you should run it yourself if you have first cloned this solution from your source control, or added a new client-side package dependency to your solution.
* Run `KekikStream.Webtop.DbMigrator` to create the initial database. This step is also automatically done when you create a new solution, if you didn't especially disabled it. This should be done in the first run. It is also needed if a new database migration is added to the solution later.
